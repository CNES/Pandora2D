.. _refinement:

Refinement of the disparity maps
================================

Theoretical basics
------------------
The purpose of this step is to refine the disparity identified in the previous step.

The available refinement methods are:
    * **Interpolation**:

        It consists on 3 different steps:
            * First, the cost_volumes is reshaped to obtain the 2D (disp_row, disp_col) costs map for each pixel, so we will obtain (row * col) 2D cost maps.
            * The cost map of each pixel is interpolated using scipy to obtain a continuous function.
            * Then, the interpolated functions are minimized using scipy to obtain the refined disparities.

    * **Dichotomy**:

        Itâ€™s an iterative process that will, at each iteration:
            * compute the half way positions between each best candidate in the cost volume and its nearest neighbours.
            * compute the similarity coefficients at those positions using the given filter method.
            * find the new best candidate from those computed coefficients.
