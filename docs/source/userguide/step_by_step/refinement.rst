Refinement of the disparity maps
================================
The purpose of this step is to refine the disparity identified in the previous step.

Interpolation method
--------------------

It consists on 3 different steps:

    * First, the cost_volumes is reshaped to obtain the 2D (disp_row, disp_col) costs map for each pixel, so we will obtain (row * col) 2D cost maps.
    * The cost map of each pixel is interpolated using scipy to obtain a continuous function.
    * Then, the interpolated functions are minimized using scipy to obtain the refined disparities.

.. warning::
    When using the interpolation method, row and column disparity ranges must have a size greater than or equal to 5. 

Optical_flow method
-------------------
.. warning::
    The optical flow method is still in an experimental phase.
    The parameter window_size in the matching cost parameters require a value greater than 1 .

Inspired by [Lucas & Kanade]_.'s algorithm

    * We first need to suppose that pixel's shifting are subpixel between left and right images.
    * Second, we need to suppose brightness constancy between left and right images. (2)
    * Now, we can write :

    .. math::

        I(x, y, t) &= I(x + dx, y + dy, t + dt) \\
        I(x, y, t) &=  I(x, y, t) + \frac{\partial I}{\partial x}\partial x + \frac{\partial I}{\partial y}\partial y +\frac{\partial I}{\partial t}\partial t

    with hypothesis (2) :

    .. math::

         \frac{\partial I}{\partial x} dx + \frac{\partial I}{\partial y} dy + \frac{\partial I}{\partial t}dt = 0

    after dividing by :math:`dt`:

    .. math::

         \frac{\partial I}{\partial x} \frac{dx}{dt} + \frac{\partial I}{\partial y} \frac{dy}{dt} = - \frac{\partial I}{\partial t}

    * We can resolve v thanks to least squares method  :

    .. math::

        v = (A^T A)^{-1}A^T B

    * Lucas & Kanade works on a pixel and his neighbourhood so :

    .. math::

        A =
            \left(\begin{array}{cc}
            I_x(q1) & I_y(q1)\\
            I_x(q2) & I_y(q2) \\
            . & . \\
            . & . \\
            . & . \\
            I_x(qn) & I_y(qn)
            \end{array}\right)

        v =
            \left(\begin{array}{cc}
            V_x\\
            V_y
            \end{array}\right)


        B =
            \left(\begin{array}{cc}
            -I_t(q1) \\
            -I_t(q2)  \\
            .  \\
            .  \\
            .  \\
            -I_t(qn)
            \end{array}\right)

The following diagram presents the different steps implemented in Pandora2d to enable
the refinement of the disparity map with optical flow.

Dichotomy method
----------------

Itâ€™s an iterative process that will, at each iteration:
    * compute the half way positions between each best candidate in the cost volume and its nearest neighbours.
    * compute the similarity coefficients at those positions using the given filter method.
    * find the new best candidate from those computed coefficients.

Available filters are described in :ref:`interpolation_filters`.
